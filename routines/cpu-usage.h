;; CPU Usage calculator.
;;
;; This module allows for an estimation of the CPU usage.
;;
;; It uses a bogo counter that is incremented on idle (waiting
;; for next frame) and comparing it to a reference we can
;; calculate the CPU usage.
;;
;; The formula to calculate the CPU usage is:
;;
;;       1 - (CurrentBogo) / (ReferenceBogo * (MissedFrames + 1))
;;
;; It also alerts you to missed frames. If 
;;
;; In order to use this module, the following must occour.
;;
;;  * `CPU_Usage__NMI` must active on every VBlank Inturrupt.
;;
;;  * `CPU_Usage__Calc_Idle` must be called once.
;;
;;  * `CPU_Usage__Wait_Frame` must be called instead of `WAI`
