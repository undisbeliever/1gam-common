;; This module is a Linear congruential psudeo random number generator.
;;
;; In order to increase the observed randomness of this module,
;; the function `AddJoypadEntropy` should be called once every frame.
;; This will cycle the random number generator once or twice, depending
;; on the state of JOY1.

IMPORT_MODULE Random

	UINT32	seed

	;; Runs the random seed through a single pass of the seed
	;; REQUIRE: 8 bit A
	;; RETURN: bits 16-23 of seed
	ROUTINE Rnd

	;; Adds entropy to the random seed by calling `Rnd`
	;;	* twice if the state of JOY1 has changed since the last call.
	;;	* once if the joypad hasn't changed.
	;;
	;; This can add a bit of variety to the random number generator.
